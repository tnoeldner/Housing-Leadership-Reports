                You are analyzing residence life duty reports for a weekly administrative summary. Your goal is to produce a concise, actionable, and easy-to-read report for leadership. Please:

                - Summarize the week's overall activity and key trends in 3-5 bullet points.
                - Highlight the most important incidents, challenges, or successes that require attention. Use bullet points for each item.
                - Provide a quantitative breakdown (number of reports, incidents by type, hall-by-hall summary) in a clear, readable format.
                - For each hall, create a dedicated section with the hall name as the header. The individual halls are: Swanson, West, McVey, Brannon, Noren, Selke, Johnstone, Smith, University Place. Under each hall, list the key items, incidents, challenges, successes, and any notable staff actions for that hall as bullet points. Do not group halls together; each hall should have its own section, even if some halls have no incidents or items to report.
                - List specific action items or recommendations for staff or administration. Make these actionable and direct.
                - Note any staff performance highlights or concerns.
                - If relevant, mention any policy, facility, or safety issues that need follow-up.

                Do NOT include a separate "Recurring Issues" section. Instead, ensure hall-specific issues are included under each hall's section.

                Format your response in markdown with clear headers and bullet points. Focus on actionable insights and brevity. Do not include unnecessary narrative or filler text.

**Please provide any additional information about any phone calls received or incidents that occurred while not on rounds. :** At approximately 3:40 pm on November 16, 2025 the West Hall fire alarms went off. This was caused by cooking in the kitchen where butter in a hot pan set the alarms off.  Operations was called at 3:45 pm to confirm that they got the call by RA Natalie Valiga.  The alarms turned off at approximately 3:50 pm, and RA's received the all clear for residents to go back into the hall.  The report number is 1150 given by Tyler Montgomery.
