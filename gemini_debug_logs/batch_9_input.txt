This was caused by cooking in the kitchen where butter in a hot pan set the alarms off.  Operations was called at 3:45 pm to confirm that they got the call by RA Natalie Valiga.  The alarms turned off at approximately 3:50 pm, and RA's received the all clear for residents to go back into the hall.  The report number is 1150 given by Tyler Montgomery.
