**Round Summary: While on my first round, the following occurred:** We began my first round at 5:15 pm. The round began on ground floor of Wilkerson. There were some students doing homework, but other than studious activities, nothing was out of the ordinary. We rotated to the landing zone and did a lap around the quad, no mess was found. We began our interior round on ground floor. There was some poster on the floor we tried to pick up, but it didn’t take long for it to fall down. Petition to get Lauren her cork board. Kitchen appliances looked good, nothing was dirty. Rest in peace to the washer and dryer. A work order has been placed. 1st floor was good, nothing special. 2nd floor had some people studying and everything looks good. We saw some people playing chess on the third floor and stood there to commentate for a while. We ended our interior round on 4th floor. Some residents were watching Mormon wives, but other than that, all is good.

**Round Summary: While on my second round, the following occurred:** We began our 2nd at 10:10 outside. Highly do not recommend doing that anymore… it was cold. No trash was found, no windows were open when we were doing rounds. We began our interior round on the ground floor, we picked up some posters but that was about it. 1st floor was really empty. However, Thien did find two "wet area sign" on the table of east wing. The signs are now in the office. 2nd floor was clean, some chairs were sprawled everywhere but we pushed it back so it looks good. 3rd floor east side started watching Mormon wives. Apparently it’s the “new wave”. We ended the round on 4th, Thien’s resident was watching some prison fighting show. Everything was good. Another casual day in Selke. 

**I started my third round at (Weekends Only):** 12:20:00
**I ended my third round at (Weekends Only):** 12:35:00
**Round Summary: While on my third round, the following occurred (Weekends Only):** We began our rounds at 12:20. We started on 4th floor, it looked very… ominous, lights were off and there was one single chair in the middle of Thien’s common area. Nobody was in the common area. 3rd floor was really boring but clean. Not sure why but we guess people are either out or is just sleeping early. 2nd floor had some resident studying at this hour for some reason, but we were happy to see them so locked in. 1st floor had chairs kind of all over the place but it wasn’t a big deal. We ended the round on ground floor. Every entrance was secured, washer is still down, but other than that. All is good. 

**Please provide any additional information about any phone calls received or incidents that occurred while not on rounds. :** 6:49 - Sebastian called to borrow a vacuum
