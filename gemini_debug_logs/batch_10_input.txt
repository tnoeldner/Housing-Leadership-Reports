**Please provide any additional information about any phone calls received or incidents that occurred while not on rounds. :** Recieved a call from RA Meris about a loud beeping noise and flashing light coming from outside the elevator. RA Brooke called the CA on duty who then called JCI to come see what the problem was. JCI could not fix the issue so JCI filled out a UIT ticket. The CA on duty called the RD on duty to ask what we should do since the issue couldn’t be resolved. The RD on duty said to mark every elevator with an “out of order” sign. Brooke then marked every elevator with said signs.

During the elevator issues, Brooke received a call from RD Sophia who was wondering what the issue was so Sophia could inform Moses about the issue. Brooke relayed the situation to Sophia.

Brooke also recieved a call about a resident wanted to sign out a bowl after desk shift was over. Brooke went down to the office to have them check out a bowl.
