West Lounge: West lounge is clear and quiet, deserted islands. No one is alive.
East Lounge: there are three residents watching the fight the UFC fight there’s four minutes and 45 seconds left in the fight. They are interrogating me about who is on the phone but it is no one little they know I’m documenting that they’re harassing me.

Floor 3:

East Lounge: there is actually not a single soul on this floor we can hear talking coming from 304 but other than that, there’s dirty tables some foods left out to be shared. That looks like interesting frosting on that donut.
West Lounge: there’s a resident studying in the lounge I mean in the study hall there’s nobody in the lounge, but it looks very nice 
Floor 2:

West Lounge: per usual there’s about 1 million residents on the floor two are playing video games one is playing something on the TV to our watching. I believe we’re doing whatever it is that they’re doing they all look at me suspiciously. I walk away unbothered
East Lounge: I can actually hear noise coming from the side of my floor. I wonder what it is. They’re doing Kate wonders the same there’s music playing. Kate is surprised that there are so many people on the floor. What is going on? There are five residents playing poker, gambling, their lives away, not caring about their grades or their lives or their futures. They bullied and harassed me so I left. They greet me as RA. Do I like it no do I love them? Yes they’re playing cards against humanity. The card that I’m reading says how far I can get my own penis up my butt. Hara, I hope you’re not reading this. They gave me a giggle. Cait also thought it was quite joyous.
Floor 1:

East Lounge: their lights are on nobody is home. Daniel is in the RA office doing homework because we just saw him.
West side: there is absolutely nothing going on on the floor right now, but I’m gonna rip a fat one and walk away. 

Outside: outside it is frigid many lights are off. There’s no one in the quad no one at the fire. There are nothing to the windows that we should be concerned about the stars are out and I’m looking into Kate‘s eyes and we get so close to kissing, but we don’t. she starts spinning around I refuse. 
Ground Floor: in the landing zone there are five students playing poker. Why is everybody so into gambling? They’re just so happy to be absolutely no residence passed out in the landing zone bathrooms.Yay!
The same resident from earlier who happened to spill water everywhere is still in the laundry room. The laundry room is clean. It smells great. The resident looks awesome. Nothing is happening. Nothing is going on. There is nothing exciting. There are three residents sitting in the kitchen seating watching something.
