                You are analyzing residence life duty reports for a weekly administrative summary. Your goal is to produce a concise, actionable, and easy-to-read report for leadership. Please:

                - Summarize the week's overall activity and key trends in 3-5 bullet points.
                - Highlight the most important incidents, challenges, or successes that require attention. Use bullet points for each item.
                - Provide a quantitative breakdown (number of reports, incidents by type, hall-by-hall summary) in a clear, readable format.
                - For each hall, create a dedicated section with the hall name as the header. The individual halls are: Swanson, West, McVey, Brannon, Noren, Selke, Johnstone, Smith, University Place. Under each hall, list the key items, incidents, challenges, successes, and any notable staff actions for that hall as bullet points. Do not group halls together; each hall should have its own section, even if some halls have no incidents or items to report.
                - List specific action items or recommendations for staff or administration. Make these actionable and direct.
                - Note any staff performance highlights or concerns.
                - If relevant, mention any policy, facility, or safety issues that need follow-up.

                Do NOT include a separate "Recurring Issues" section. Instead, ensure hall-specific issues are included under each hall's section.

                Format your response in markdown with clear headers and bullet points. Focus on actionable insights and brevity. Do not include unnecessary narrative or filler text.

There were some students doing homework, but other than studious activities, nothing was out of the ordinary. We rotated to the landing zone and did a lap around the quad, no mess was found. We began our interior round on ground floor. There was some poster on the floor we tried to pick up, but it didn’t take long for it to fall down. Petition to get Lauren her cork board. Kitchen appliances looked good, nothing was dirty. Rest in peace to the washer and dryer. A work order has been placed. 1st floor was good, nothing special. 2nd floor had some people studying and everything looks good. We saw some people playing chess on the third floor and stood there to commentate for a while. We ended our interior round on 4th floor.

No trash was found, no windows were open when we were doing rounds. We began our interior round on the ground floor, we picked up some posters but that was about it. 1st floor was really empty. However, Thien did find two "wet area sign" on the table of east wing. The signs are now in the office. 2nd floor was clean, some chairs were sprawled everywhere but we pushed it back so it looks good. 3rd floor east side started watching Mormon wives. Apparently it’s the “new wave”. We ended the round on 4th, Thien’s resident was watching some prison fighting show. Everything was good. Another casual day in Selke.

Nobody was in the common area. 3rd floor was really boring but clean. Not sure why but we guess people are either out or is just sleeping early. 2nd floor had some resident studying at this hour for some reason, but we were happy to see them so locked in. 1st floor had chairs kind of all over the place but it wasn’t a big deal. We ended the round on ground floor. Every entrance was secured, washer is still down, but other than that. All is good.
