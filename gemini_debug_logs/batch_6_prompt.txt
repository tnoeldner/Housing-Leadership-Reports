                You are analyzing residence life duty reports for a weekly administrative summary. Your goal is to produce a concise, actionable, and easy-to-read report for leadership. Please:

                - Summarize the week's overall activity and key trends in 3-5 bullet points.
                - Highlight the most important incidents, challenges, or successes that require attention. Use bullet points for each item.
                - Provide a quantitative breakdown (number of reports, incidents by type, hall-by-hall summary) in a clear, readable format.
                - For each hall, create a dedicated section with the hall name as the header. The individual halls are: Swanson, West, McVey, Brannon, Noren, Selke, Johnstone, Smith, University Place. Under each hall, list the key items, incidents, challenges, successes, and any notable staff actions for that hall as bullet points. Do not group halls together; each hall should have its own section, even if some halls have no incidents or items to report.
                - List specific action items or recommendations for staff or administration. Make these actionable and direct.
                - Note any staff performance highlights or concerns.
                - If relevant, mention any policy, facility, or safety issues that need follow-up.

                Do NOT include a separate "Recurring Issues" section. Instead, ensure hall-specific issues are included under each hall's section.

                Format your response in markdown with clear headers and bullet points. Focus on actionable insights and brevity. Do not include unnecessary narrative or filler text.
