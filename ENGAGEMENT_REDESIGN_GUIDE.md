# REDESIGNED ENGAGEMENT ANALYSIS SYSTEM
## Complete Event Lifecycle Management for Fall Semester

### Overview of Changes

The engagement analysis system has been completely redesigned to properly handle the event lifecycle from proposal submission to event completion, with a focus on Fall semester operations (August 22 - December 31).

### Key Changes Made

#### 1. Event Status Management
- **OLD**: Events only showed as "cancelled" vs generic status
- **NEW**: Proper mapping of "Event Approval" field to event status:
  - `Approved` → status: "approved" 
  - `Cancelled`/`Canceled` → status: "cancelled"
  - Blank/null → status: "pending"
  - Events progress through: Proposal → Pending → Approved → Completed

#### 2. Semester-Long Data Management
- **OLD**: Analysis period based on form submission dates
- **NEW**: Fall semester view (August 22 - December 31)
- Events are unique records that get updated as they progress
- Each event has a unique `form_submission_id` for tracking

#### 3. Enhanced Database Schema
- **Complete form mapping**: All fields from Residence Life Event Submission form
- **Event approval tracking**: Maps "Event Approval" field to determine status
- **Attendance tracking**: Both anticipated (from proposal) and actual (post-event)
- **Complete event details**: Scheduling, location, budget, partnerships, etc.
- **Generated status column**: Automatically determines status from approval field

#### 4. Weekly Analysis Logic
- **Past Week Review**: Shows approved events that happened in the last 7 days
- **Upcoming Events**: Shows approved events scheduled for next 7 days  
- **Attendance Updates**: Tracks actual vs anticipated attendance for completed events
- **Semester Progress**: Overall statistics and trend analysis

#### 5. Data Extraction Improvements
- **Complete form download**: Stores entire form as JSONB for future reference
- **Enhanced field mapping**: Specific mapping for all form fields
- **Robust date parsing**: Handles multiple date/time formats
- **Event categorization**: Proper event type and theme classification

### Database Schema Updates

```sql
-- Key new fields in engagement_report_data table:
event_approval TEXT,           -- "Event Approval" from form
event_status GENERATED,        -- Auto-calculated from approval
anticipated_attendance INT,    -- From proposal
actual_attendance INT,         -- Updated after completion
form_responses JSONB,          -- Complete form data
semester TEXT,                 -- Fall 2024 tracking
academic_year TEXT             -- 2024-2025
```

### New Workflow

#### 1. Initial Event Proposal
- Event submitted via Residence Life Event Submission form
- Status: "pending" (Event Approval is blank)
- Data extracted and stored with anticipated attendance
- Unique `form_submission_id` assigned

#### 2. Event Approval Process  
- "Event Approval" field updated to "Approved" or "Cancelled"
- Status automatically updates via generated column
- Approved events become visible in upcoming events lists

#### 3. Weekly Analysis Generation
- **Completed Events**: Approved events from past 7 days
- **Upcoming Events**: Approved events for next 7 days  
- **Attendance Analysis**: Compare anticipated vs actual attendance
- **Semester Progress**: Overall fall semester statistics

#### 4. Event Completion
- Actual attendance can be updated post-event
- Event marked as "completed" 
- Data becomes part of historical analysis

### Technical Implementation

#### Enhanced Data Extraction (`extract_engagement_quantitative_data`)
- Processes complete form structure
- Maps all fields to appropriate database columns
- Handles Fall semester date filtering (Aug 22 - Dec 31)
- Provides comprehensive statistics and debugging info

#### Improved Save Logic (`save_engagement_data`)
- Upsert pattern: Creates new events or updates existing ones
- Uses `form_submission_id` for uniqueness
- Tracks creation vs update operations
- Provides detailed feedback on operations

#### Weekly Analysis (`create_weekly_engagement_report_summary`)
- Analyzes events by date ranges and approval status
- Separates completed vs upcoming events
- Provides actionable insights for supervisors
- Includes semester-wide context

### Benefits of New System

1. **Accurate Event Tracking**: Each event is unique and tracked through its lifecycle
2. **Proper Status Management**: Events have clear approval and completion states  
3. **Semester Visibility**: Complete view of Fall semester programming
4. **Weekly Intelligence**: Focused analysis of recent and upcoming events
5. **Data Integrity**: Complete form preservation and robust field mapping
6. **Supervisor Insights**: Actionable information for staff support and resource planning

### Migration Steps

1. **Database Update**: Run `ENHANCED_ENGAGEMENT_SCHEMA.sql`
2. **Data Refresh**: Re-run engagement analysis to populate with new logic
3. **Testing**: Verify event status mapping and date filtering
4. **Training**: Update staff on new weekly analysis format

### Usage Instructions

#### For Weekly Reports:
1. Select "Weekly Summary Report" option
2. System automatically looks at:
   - Completed approved events from past 7 days
   - Upcoming approved events for next 7 days
   - Overall semester progress

#### For Semester Analysis:  
1. Select "Standard Analysis" option
2. System processes all Fall semester events (Aug 22 - Dec 31)
3. Shows complete picture of programming activity

#### For Data Management:
1. Events are automatically created/updated on each analysis run
2. Use "Save Quantitative Data" to persist semester-long event database
3. Each event maintains its unique identity throughout the semester

This redesigned system provides the comprehensive event lifecycle management requested, with proper approval status tracking, semester-long visibility, and focused weekly analysis capabilities.
