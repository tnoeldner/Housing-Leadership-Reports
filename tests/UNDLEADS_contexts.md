This Technical Requirement Document (TRD) translates the strategic concepts of UND LEADS (Learning, Equity, Affinity, Discovery, Service) into a software architectural specification. This document is formatted for a coding agent to implement a system that tracks, measures, and enforces these core values.

Technical Requirement Document: UND LEADS System
1. System Overview
System Name: UND_LEADS_Core Purpose: To architect an operating environment where every UserAction and SystemProcess aligns with the five immutable pillars of the strategic plan. Target Output: A quantifiable "Impact Score" based on the aggregation of L, E, A, D, and S metrics.

2. Data Structures
2.1 Core Enums (The Pillars)
The system must validate all inputs against the LeadPillar enum.

TypeScript

enum LeadPillar {
  LEARNING = "LEARNING",   // Wonder, technical skill, lifelong growth
  EQUITY = "EQUITY",       // Inclusion, belonging, access
  AFFINITY = "AFFINITY",   // Community connection, school pride
  DISCOVERY = "DISCOVERY", // Innovation, research, exploration
  SERVICE = "SERVICE"      // Local/global impact, resource sharing
}
2.2 The User Entity
Users are the primary drivers of the system (Students, Faculty, Staff, Alumni).

TypeScript

interface User {
  id: string;
  role: 'STUDENT' | 'FACULTY' | 'STAFF' | 'ALUMNI';
  attributes: {
    belonging_score: float; // Related to EQUITY
    skill_level: number;    // Related to LEARNING
  };
  history: ActionLog[];
}
2.3 The Action/Event Object
Every interaction within the university ecosystem is treated as an Event that must tag at least one pillar.

TypeScript

interface UniversityEvent {
  eventId: string;
  actor: User;
  type: string; // e.g., "Attend Class", "Publish Paper", "Volunteer"
  
  // The 'Rules' defined require mapping actions to specific pillars
  pillars_activated: LeadPillar[]; 
  
  impact_magnitude: number; // 1-10 scale of effectiveness
}
3. Core Logic & Business Rules
3.1 The Learning Logic (L)
Rule: If an event is tagged LEARNING, it must result in a measurable increase in user capability or curiosity.

Input: ClassSession, MentorshipMeeting

Logic: User.skill_level must increment.

Constraint: Learning events cannot be passive; they must require active_engagement.

3.2 The Equity Logic (E)
Rule: System access and success rates must be statistically invariant across demographic groups.

Check: Before executing high-stakes processes (e.g., Admissions, Hiring), run bias_check().

Logic:

Python

def validate_equity(process):
    if process.accessibility_score < THRESHOLD:
        raise EquityViolationException("Belonging criteria not met.")
    return True
3.3 The Affinity Logic (A)
Rule: Interactions must strengthen the graph connection between nodes (Users).

Logic: Successful AFFINITY events increase the connection_strength between User and Institution.

Requirement: The system must flag isolated nodes (users with low affinity scores) for intervention.

3.4 The Discovery Logic (D)
Rule: The system must incentivize novel outputs over redundant ones.

Logic:

IF Event.type == RESEARCH OR INNOVATION:

THEN verify novelty_index > 0.

Outcome: Add to GlobalKnowledgeBase.

3.5 The Service Logic (S)
Rule: Resources generated by the system must have an external output flow (Community Impact).

Logic: SystemResources cannot be purely internal. A percentage must be routed to ExternalBeneficiaries (local/global community).

4. User Flows
4.1 The "Impact" Loop (Main Execution Flow)
This flow describes how a user interacts with the LEADS system to generate value.

Initialization: User initiates an Action (e.g., "Start a Student Org").

Classification: System classifies the Action against LeadPillar Enums.

Example: Student Org = AFFINITY + SERVICE.

Validation:

Does it promote belonging? (Equity Check: PASS)

Does it help the community? (Service Check: PASS)

Execution: The Action is committed to the database.

Feedback: The User receives an updated "LEADS Profile" showing growth in Affinity and Service areas.

4.2 The "Belonging" Algorithm (Equity/Affinity Flow)
Monitor: System scans User.belonging_score periodically.

Trigger: If score < min_threshold:

Action: Dispatch InterventionBot (e.g., Peer Mentor, Advisor).

Goal: Restore belonging_score via AFFINITY events.

5. System Constraints & Guidelines
Holistic Requirement: No single pillar can be maximized to the detriment of EQUITY. (e.g., You cannot pursue DISCOVERY in a way that violates EQUITY).

Integration: All sub-modules (Housing, Academics, Athletics) must inherit from the UND_LEADS_Core class.

Transparency: All logic regarding EQUITY and SERVICE calculations must be visible to the end-user.
