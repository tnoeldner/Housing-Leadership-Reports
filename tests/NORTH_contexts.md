Technical Requirement Document: Guiding NORTH Interactive Training Module

Version: 1.0
Date: November 21, 2025
Project: Guiding NORTH - Interactive Communication Training Tools

1. Project Overview

The goal is to develop a set of interactive, AI-powered training tools embedded within a web-based documentation platform. These tools enable University of North Dakota Housing & Residence Life staff to practice and refine their communication skills based on the "Guiding NORTH" framework.

2. Core Logic & Framework (The NORTH Standard)

All AI evaluations and generations must strictly adhere to the following five pillars.

2.1. N - Navigate Needs

Core Concept: Listen first to understand the real issue, not just the surface question.

Validation Criteria:

Does the response ask clarifying questions?

Does it acknowledge the user's perspective/feelings (empathy)?

Does it explain the "why" behind processes?

2.2. O - Own the Outcome

Core Concept: Personal responsibility for resolution.

Validation Criteria:

Does the responder take ownership (e.g., "I will handle this")?

Are handoffs "warm" (providing context), avoiding "bouncing"?

Is there a commitment to follow up/see it through?

2.3. R - Respond Respectfully

Core Concept: Tone and language build trust.

Validation Criteria:

Is the tone positive, professional, and patient?

Is the language plain and accessible (no internal jargon)?

Does the responder maintain composure/de-escalate?

2.4. T - Timely & Truthful

Core Concept: Swift and reliable guidance.

Validation Criteria:

Adherence to the 24-hour response rule (implied in scenarios).

Is the information accurate and verified?

Is there honesty about delays or complications?

2.5. H - Help Proactively

Core Concept: Anticipate terrain and clear the path.

Validation Criteria:

Does the response create/reference FAQs or guides?

Does it clearly clarify "next steps"?

Does it identify process improvements?

3. Feature Specifications

3.1. Feature 1: Scenario Simulator

User Flow:

User clicks "Generate Scenario".

System calls LLM to generate a realistic housing conflict scenario (under 100 words, e.g., roommate conflict, billing issue).

User types a response into a text area.

User clicks "Evaluate Response".

System calls LLM to grade the response against the N.O.R.T.H. rubric (A-F grade + constructive feedback).

Data Inputs:

scenario_context (Generated by AI)

user_response (String)

Data Outputs:

evaluation_feedback (Markdown formatted text)

3.2. Feature 2: Tone Polisher

User Flow:

User pastes a rough draft email/message into a text area.

User clicks "Polish with Guiding NORTH".

System calls LLM to rewrite the draft.

Transformation Logic:

Input: Rough, potentially informal or jargon-heavy text.

Processing: Apply N.O.R.T.H. principles (Validate feelings, remove jargon, use "I" statements, clarify next steps).

Output: Polished, professional email body.

4. System Architecture & Rules

4.1. Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML5, Tailwind CSS (via CDN).

Logic: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+).

AI Integration: Gemini API (model: gemini-2.5-flash-preview-09-2025).

Markdown Parsing: markdown-it library.

4.2. Specific Rules

Printing Behavior: Interactive tools (Scenario Simulator, Tone Polisher) MUST be hidden when printing (.no-print class in CSS @media print).

Error Handling: API calls must include try/catch blocks. Failures should display user-friendly error messages ("I apologize, but I encountered an error...").

State Management: * Maintain currentScenario state for the Simulator.

Disable buttons during API loading states.

Show visual loading indicators (spinners) during processing.

4.3. Prompt Engineering Standards

Scenario Generation Prompt: Must specify "realistic," "slightly stressful," and "under 100 words."

Evaluation Prompt: Must explicitly list the 5 N.O.R.T.H. points as grading criteria.

Polishing Prompt: Must explicitly instruct the model to remove jargon and validate feelings first.
