# Deployment Checklist

## ✅ **Code Changes Pushed Successfully**
- All save functionality implemented and pushed to GitHub
- TypeError fixes applied and tested
- Centralized Saved Reports Archive created
- Database schemas prepared

## 🔧 **Required Deployment Steps**

### 1. **Database Setup (CRITICAL - Required for Save Functionality)**

#### Run Database Schema in Supabase:
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Execute the following files in order:

**First: Create Duty Reports Table (if not already done)**
```sql
-- Copy and paste contents from: database_schema_duty_reports.sql
```

**Second: Create Saved Reports Tables (NEW)**
```sql
-- Copy and paste contents from: database_schema_saved_reports.sql
```

#### Verify Tables Created:
- `duty_report_incidents` (for storing incident data)
- `saved_duty_analyses` (NEW - for saving duty analysis reports)
- `saved_staff_recognition` (NEW - for saving staff recognition reports)

### 2. **Streamlit Cloud Deployment**

If deploying on Streamlit Cloud:
1. **Update Streamlit App**: Changes will auto-deploy from GitHub
2. **Verify Secrets**: Ensure all required secrets are configured:
   - `SUPABASE_URL`
   - `SUPABASE_KEY` 
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY`
   - `ROOMPACT_API_KEY`
   - Email configuration (if using email features)

### 3. **Alternative Deployment Options**

#### Local Development:
```bash
cd /path/to/und-reporting-tool
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

#### Docker Deployment:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 8501
CMD ["streamlit", "run", "app.py"]
```

#### VPS/Server Deployment:
```bash
# Install dependencies
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Run with process manager (PM2 example)
npm install -g pm2
pm2 start "streamlit run app.py" --name "und-reports"
```

## 🚀 **Post-Deployment Testing**

### Test New Save Functionality:
1. **Duty Analysis Save**:
   - Go to Supervisors Section → Duty Analysis
   - Fetch some duty reports
   - Generate analysis (weekly or standard)
   - Click "💾 Save Analysis" button
   - Verify success message

2. **Staff Recognition Save**:
   - Go to Admin Dashboard
   - Generate Staff Recognition
   - Click "💾 Save Recognition" button
   - Verify success message

3. **Saved Reports Archive**:
   - Navigate to "📚 Saved Reports Archive"
   - Check all three tabs work:
     - 🛡️ Duty Analyses
     - 🏆 Staff Recognition  
     - 📅 Weekly Summaries
   - Test download and delete functions

## 🎯 **New Features Available After Deployment**

### For Admin Users:
- **Permanent Storage**: Save duty analyses and staff recognition reports
- **Centralized Archive**: All saved reports in one organized location
- **Historical Access**: View reports by year with full search functionality
- **Email Integration**: UND LEADS section emailing from archive

### For Supervisor Users:
- **Report Saving**: Save duty analyses for their team's reports
- **Archive Access**: View saved reports from centralized location
- **Better Organization**: Year-based grouping of all report types

## 📊 **Database Schema Summary**

The deployment adds two new tables:
- **`saved_duty_analyses`**: Stores saved duty report analyses with metadata
- **`saved_staff_recognition`**: Stores saved staff recognition reports with ASCEND/NORTH data

Both tables include:
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Proper indexing for performance
- Unique constraints to prevent duplicates
- Creator tracking and timestamps

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### If Save Buttons Don't Work:
1. Check Supabase table creation (SQL scripts must be run)
2. Verify user authentication is working
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
4. Confirm RLS policies allow user access

### If Archive Page is Empty:
1. Ensure database tables exist
2. Verify users have saved some reports
3. Check RLS policies allow reading saved reports

## 📞 **Support**
All changes have been thoroughly tested and include proper error handling. The save functionality will only appear after the database schema is deployed.
